# Analytics-app

This is the repository for the analytics pipeline. As a sidenote, some of our analytics pipeline is already covered with the use of the Firebase Analytics and Performance connections made with the front end apps, that allow us to visualize some important data about our users location, devices, loading times in screens, etc. However, this repository covers the extraction, processing and visualization using Microsoft's PowerBI tool of some of the data that could be useful for us or 3-rd parties.
